# Single-Particle Benchmark for PIC Particle Pushing

This repository contains three MATLAB scripts for benchmarking particle pushing algorithms commonly used in Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations:

1. **MSPIC.m** – High-precision Multi-Step Particle-In-Cell Algorithm  
2. **Boris.m** – Boris Algorithm  
3. **DirectIm.m** – Direct Implicit Algorithm  

Each script computes the time evolution of the particle’s position, velocity, and energy under various electromagnetic field configurations. You can modify parameters such as time step size, grid resolution, and field setup to explore different scenarios.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the folder containing the scripts.  
3. Run any of the scripts (e.g., `MSPIC.m`) to simulate single-particle motion.  
4. Adjust parameters as needed in the code to investigate different conditions.
